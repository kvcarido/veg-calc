# Vegetable Calculator

A simple util to calculate the costs of your farmer's market veggies üçÉüí®

## Introduction

This idea came to me while trying to figure out how much my sister owes me for buying vegetables for her at the farmer's market. For the sake of learning in public (and quite frankly, efficiency), I decided to put my front-end learning to the test and build a tool I can call upon that meets my very specific needs.

## Tech Stack

This lightweight util is built from scratch using the simpler things in life ‚Äì HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

## Lessons Learned

Although I didn't learn anything particularly ground-breaking, building this project helped strengthen multiple things:

- Created a useful tool that I'll utilize over time
- Helped with following through the philosophy of learning in public
- Allowed me to be creative with web design
- Discovered [glitch.com](https://glitch.com), an easy way to create a web app
  - _although I ended up switching to a local environment to finish, I love that Glitch removes the boundaries for collaborating and deploying_
- Practice building out website functionality and DOM manipulation with JavaScript

## Roadmap

- [x] Add attribution header + footer
- [ ] Subtotal calculator ‚Äì add multiple line items
- [ ] Add `shipping price` button
- [ ] Fix `user-form` in mobile view
